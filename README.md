# WebbyBot
WebbyBot is a completely open source Discord bot.
It was programmed in Java. It is used for community / server administration and is still in the starting blocks. 
It will have many features like TicketSystems, Reaction Roles, Embed Message Sending and much more. 

You all know the "MEE6" bot?
Our bot will be able to do more, have an equally beautiful user interface and all features will be **100% for free**.

We would be happy if you invite our bot, which was created with a lot of effort, night shifts and joy, to your server. 
Your server will not only get better, but the bot will get closer and closer to being verified.

You can invite the bot at the following link:

You can use the code for inspiration or add it to your own bots. 

But please note:
Our code may not be sold under any other name.

Thanks to all who use our bot!
